# Challenge 1

## Overview and Origin

* Poet Technologies

* Poet Technologies was incorporated in 1972 and is headqurtered in Toronto Canada. It was originally named Opel Technologies but was renamed to Poet Technologies in June of 2013.

* The company was founded by Dr. Suresh Venkatesan.

* POET Technologies was founded with the vision of legitimizing photonics within the semiconductor industry and becoming a leader in chip-scale photonic solutions. The company’s primary goal is to seamlessly integrate electronics and photonics using its innovative Optical Interposer technology. This integration aims to enhance the cost, efficiency, and performance of various devices.

* POET Technologies’ products are utilized in diverse applications, including data centers, telecommunications, and automotive LIDAR. The company’s technology is based on a dielectric platform and wafer-level packaging techniques, which allow for cost-effective and scalable production. For instance, a standard 8-inch silicon wafer can process over 500 devices simultaneously for a 400G transceiver, making their solutions up to 75% cheaper than conventional ones while offering more built-in features and lower operational costs.

* The vision for POET Technologies is to become the global leader in chip-scale photonic solutions, driving innovation and efficiency in the industry.

* As of May 2024, POET Technologies Inc. (TSE:PTK) secured CAD$10 million in funding through a private placement offering. This funding round was supported by two Canadian institutional investors and involved the sale of over 3.4 million units at CAD$2.90 each. Each unit included a common share and a five-year warrant, allowing the holder to purchase one common share for CAD$4.26 within 60 months of the offering’s closing date. The funds raised are intended to support the company’s expansion and general working capital.

## Business Activities

* Poet Technologies is address the need for high-speed and low-latency networks using an optical solution that is highly scalable and at the desired cost structure that many AI components and companies require.

* Poet Technologies inteded customer is large datacenters and companies that have their own datacenters and need low latency, scalable solutions, especially for the purposes of AI.

* POET's Optical Interposer eliminates costly components and labor-intensive assembly, alignment, burn-in and testing methods employed in conventional photonics

* POET Technologies is currently offering the following technologies that offer an advantage over their compettitors:
  * POET Optical Interposer: A platform technology that integrates electronic and photonic devices into a single multi-chip module. It eliminates the need for costly components and labor-intensive assembly methods.
  * POET Starlight: A light engine custom built for the AI market.
  * POET Infinity: A chiplet-based transmitter for 400G, 800G, 1.6T, and more.
  * POET Wavelight: An 800G 2xFR4 transceiver with 8 lanes of electrical input and output channels. It's designed for 800 gigabit ethernet links and operates at 106.25Gbps/channel.
  * POET LightBar: A packaged light source for AI and CPO applications.

## Landscape

* POET Technologies operates in a single segment of design, manufacture, and sale of semiconductor products and services for commercial applications.

* Some major trends in the industry in the last 5 to 10 years have been: <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>
  * Increased Demand in the Automotive and AI Sectors.
  * As environmental concerns grow, the semiconductor industry is focusing on sustainability.
  * Innovations in semiconductor technology, such as the development of 3nm and 5nm process nodes.
  * The industry is witnessing a regional shift, with significant investments in semiconductor manufacturing capacity in Asia, particularly in China, Taiwan, and South Korea.

* Some other major companies in this field are:
  * Intel
  * Qualcomm
  * AMD
  * TSMC

## Results

* Some recent business impacts of POET Technologies has been:
  ** POET was selected as winner of the “Best Optical AI Solution” award in the seventh annual AI Breakthrough Awards program conducted by AI Breakthrough, a leading market intelligence organization that recognizes the top companies, technologies and products in the global Artificial Intelligence (AI) market today.
  ** During the second quarter, the Company raised $15 million in equity capital in two non-brokered private placements with two institutional investors by issuing 6,706,665 Units at an average price of $2.24 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one common share and one common share purchase warrant with each warrant exercisable into one common share for a period

* Some core metrics of the companies success from Q2 2024 are:
  ** Through the use of its ATM facility during the month of April 2024, the Company raised gross proceeds of $7,447,000 from the issuance of 4,592,739 common shares at an average price of $1.62 per common share.
  ** Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company raised an additional $10 million in a non-brokered registered direct offering to a single institutional investor by issuing 3,333,334 Units at $3.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one common share and one common share purchase warrant with each warrant exercisable into one common share for a period of five years from the issue date at $4.00 per share.
  ** The Company’s cash balance as of June 30, 2024 was $21.3 million; as of July 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $28.7 million and working capital of $27 million. There are 65,596,234 issued and outstanding common shares.

* While POET technologies is a much smaller company than the major competitors in the semi-conductor space it is uniquely poised to offer a propietary technology to non-semi-conductor companies and other semi-conductor companies alike.

## Recommendations

* POET Technologies could benefit from partnering with another larger company that can showcase the benefits of using their hardware and provide financing for further scalability.

* This would be beneficial for them as it would allow them to show the superiority of the performance of their components and gain more notoriety in the space

* This would also free up capital to work on research and development.

* There is an obvious advantage to using photonics for speed as well as energy efficiency. With the growing demand for AI services we will need to provide more environmentally friendly solutions.
